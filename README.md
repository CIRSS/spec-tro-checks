# spec-tro-checks

Checks three candidates based on the TRACE specification's own [Complete
Example](https://transparency-certified.github.io/trace-specification/docs/tro-declaration-format#complete-example)
against [`tro-checks`](https://github.com/transparency-certified/tro-checks),
and reports what it found.

This repository does not define its own checks. It performs those defined by
the `tro-checks` module on the candidates in this repository.

## Key files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`candidates/`](candidates) | The candidates checked, one `.jsonld` file each. |
| [`candidates/manifest.json`](candidates/manifest.json) | What each candidate is, and the tier this repository expects it to satisfy. |
| [`reports/`](reports) | What the checks found, one report per candidate. |
| [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) | Requires `tro-checks`. |
| [`REVIEWS.md`](REVIEWS.md) | Who has read which version of which file. |

## Running it

Requires Git, Docker and GNU Make.

```
make build-parent      # once, on a fresh clone

```

Regenerate the reports and `REVIEWS.md`:
